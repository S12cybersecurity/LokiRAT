This project implements a **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** developed from scratch. It is designed to explore and demonstrate advanced techniques used in malware development . This is not a basic tool but an implementation focusing on key functionalities that make these tools powerful.

The purpose of this project is to understand how real-world RATs function for both **offensive security** (pentesting) and **defensive security** (malware analysis, threat hunting, detection engineering). By understanding their construction, you can improve your ability to defend against them.

## üìò Learn with the Course

Each feature implemented in LokiRAT, along with the full development process of a custom Remote Access Trojan, is explained step by step in the course:
üéì Building a Custom Remote Access Trojan (RAT)

In this course, you'll learn:

- How to architect and build your own RAT from scratch

- Stealth and evasion techniques used by advanced malware

- How to build a full Command & Control infrastructure

- Windows internals, API hooking, and rootkit development

- How to implement reliable communication between client and server (C++ ‚Üî C2)

‚ö†Ô∏è The course is focused on malware development. While the repository includes a web dashboard (LokiWebViewer) built with Angular, web development fundamentals are not covered, as this is part of a Malware Development Academy. The web interface is provided for completeness, not as a teaching topic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Anti-Detection & Evasion

- **TimeStomping** ‚Äì Alters file timestamps to mimic legitimate binaries.

- **Unhook NTDLL** ‚Äì Restores a clean copy of NTDLL to bypass userland hooks.

- **Unhook NTDLL Hooks** ‚Äì Replaces hooked NTDLL with a fresh copy to evade AV/EDR instrumentation.

- **Command Line Spoofing** ‚Äì Masks malicious processes with benign command lines.

- **ETW Patcher** ‚Äì Hooks and disables ETW logging at runtime.

- **No-New Thread Execution** ‚Äì Executes shellcode without creating new threads.

- **Own VirtualAlloc (Module Stomping)** ‚Äì Executes shellcode within legitimate module memory.

### Persistence & Privilege Escalation

- **Execute EXE As Admin** ‚Äì Uses UAC bypass to escalate privileges.

- **Task Creator** ‚Äì Creates scheduled tasks for persistence.

**Privilege Escalation to SYSTEM** ‚Äì Token stealing via SYSTEM process handles.**

- **Information Gathering**

- **List Processes** ‚Äì Enumerates running processes.

- **Enumeration** ‚Äì Gathers OS, disk, registry, and network info.

- **Security Detector** ‚Äì Checks for antivirus and monitoring tools.

- **Mapping Free Handles in Memory** ‚Äì Reuses handles from trusted processes to evade detection.

### Rootkit

- **Userland Rootkit** ‚Äì Intercepts system API calls.

- **File Hider** ‚Äì Hides files and directories.

- **File Unhider** ‚Äì Restores hidden files.

- **Process Hider** ‚Äì Conceals malicious processes.

- **Registry Hider** - Hide Registry keys and values

### File Operations

- **File Upload** ‚Äì Sends files to C2 using HTTP fragmentation.

- **File Download** ‚Äì Retrieves files from C2.

- **File Explorer** ‚Äì Browses file system remotely.

### Keylogging

- **Keylogger** ‚Äì Captures and exfiltrates keystrokes.

### RDP & Credential Access

- **RDP Stealer** ‚Äì Extracts saved RDP credentials and session info.

### ETW & Memory

- **ETW Patcher** ‚Äì Neutralizes ETW logging.

- **Mapping Free Handles in Memory** ‚Äì Leverages open handles from trusted processes.

## üíª Technologies

LokiRAT is split into three main components, each using a specific technology stack suited to its role:
### üîπ Loki (C++ Agent / Client)

- **Language:** C++

- **Platform:** Windows

- **Purpose:** Compiled malware payload executed on the victim's system.

- **Highlights:** Native Windows API usage, stealth techniques, memory manipulation, anti-analysis features.

### üî∏ LokiServer (C2 Server + API)

- **Language:** C# (.NET)

- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core

- **Purpose:** Acts as the Command and Control (C2) server and provides REST API endpoints for the frontend.

- **Highlights:** Token-based security, agent registration, real-time command relay.

### üî∫ LokiWebViewer (Attacker‚Äôs Web Dashboard)

- **Language:** TypeScript

- **Framework:** Angular

- **Purpose:** Web-based frontend for attackers to manage infected agents through the C2 API.

- **Highlights:** Clean UI for remote access, data display, and command execution on victims.
