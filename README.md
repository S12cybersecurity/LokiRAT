This project implements a **Remote Access Trojan (RAT)** developed from scratch. It is designed to explore and demonstrate advanced techniques used in malware development . This is not a basic tool but an implementation focusing on key functionalities that make these tools powerful.

The purpose of this project is to understand how real-world RATs function for both **offensive security** (pentesting) and **defensive security** (malware analysis, threat hunting, detection engineering). By understanding their construction, you can improve your ability to defend against them.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### Anti-Detection & Evasion

- **TimeStomping** ‚Äì Alters file timestamps to mimic legitimate binaries.

- **Unhook NTDLL** ‚Äì Restores a clean copy of NTDLL to bypass userland hooks.

- **Unhook NTDLL Hooks** ‚Äì Replaces hooked NTDLL with a fresh copy to evade AV/EDR instrumentation.

- **Command Line Spoofing** ‚Äì Masks malicious processes with benign command lines.

- **ETW Patcher** ‚Äì Hooks and disables ETW logging at runtime.
